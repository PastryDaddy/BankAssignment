Hello, this is the readme file for the bank assignment. The Account class will handle all your dirty work, and the main program (User()) will provide the interface and surrounding functionality. Simply call the function User with your username as a parameter. Example: User(yousir). Please ensure that your username is connected with the Account class by making it a variable like this: yousir = Account(987654, "Me", 700035478653). The first parameter is account number, the second is name, the third is balance. Once you call the User function with your username as its parameter, it will do the rest. Enjoy!
